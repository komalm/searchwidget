# Sunbird React Filtering

A React filtering widget is a user interface component built using the React library that facilitates the process of filtering and refining data or content displayed on a web page. This widget is particularly useful when dealing with sunbird data or lists of items and allows users to interactively narrow down the displayed information based on their preferences or criteria.

- [NPM Package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/filtering-package)
- [Organization Repo](https://github.com/tekdi/searchwidget-react)

## Installation

- **Prerequisites:** Ensure that you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system. You can download them from the official website: Node.js Downloads.

- **Create a React App:** If you haven't already, create a React application using Create React App. This tool sets up a basic React project structure for you.

- **Navigate to Your Project Directory:** Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the root directory of your React project.
  Install the Filtering Widget Package: Use npm or yarn to install the filtering widget package. For example:

```cmd
npm install filtering-package
# or
yarn add filtering-package
```

- Import the Widget: In your React component where you want to use the filtering widget, import it at the top of your file:

```cmd

import {ApiContext} from "filtering-package"

```

## Project Setup

The project is set up in a modular fashion, with each folder containing code for a specific component or functionality. The `components` folder contains the code for the React components, which are used to render the UI. The `Filter` folder contains the code for the filter component, which allows users to filter the data. The `styled-components` folder contains the code for the styled components, which are used to style the UI. The `interfaces` folder contains the interface definitions, which are used to define the data structures used by the project.

```
api
    api.ts
    Service Function.ts

components
    card
        Card.tsx
    FetchingComponent
        ApiContext.tsx
        CardContext.tsx
        Wrapper.tsx
    Filter
        index.tsx
        Select.tsx
        SingleSelect.tsx

styled-components
    CardElements.ts
    ContextElements.ts
    SelectElements.ts

interfaces
    interface.ts
    Service Function_Interfaces.ts
    index.tsx

typings.d.ts
```

The following are some of the key files in the project setup:

### Algorithms

The `api` folder contains the code for fetching data from a remote server and filtering functions and other important functions for optimal working.

- **api.ts :** This file defines the API endpoints. It contains the functions that are used to fetch data from the remote server.
- **service_functions.ts :** The Service Function.ts file contains the service functions that are used to process the API response and additional refactoring.

### Components

- **Card :** This Folder contains the file `Card.tsx` This file defines the Card component. It is a React component that is used to render a card.
- **FetchingComponent :** It is a React component that is used and with required props for the functioning.

  - **ApiContext.tsx:** This file defines the ApiContext provider. It is a React context provider that is used to inject the API instance into the child components.
  - **CardContext.tsx:** This file defines the CardContext provider. It is used to inject the Card props into the child components.
  - **Wrapper.tsx:** This file wraps the ApiContext provider. It is used to ensure that all Card components have access to the API instance.

- **Filter :** This folder contains two files one `Select.tsx` file defines a generic select component that can be used to filter the data by any property. The `SingleSelect.tsx` file defines a specific select component that can be used to filter the data by a single property.

### Styled Components

The styled-components folder contains the code for the styled components. The `CardElements.tsx`, `ContextElements.tsx`, and `SelectElements.tsx` files define the styled components that are used to style the filter component.

### Interfaces

The interfaces folder contains the interface definitions. The `interface.ts` file defines the interface for the filter component. The `Service Function_Interfaces.ts` file defines the interface for the service functions.

## Features

- **Filtering Criteria:** Users can specify criteria or parameters by which they want to filter the data. This might include text-based searches, date ranges, categories, or any other relevant attributes.

- **Filter Inputs:** Input fields, dropdown menus, sliders, or checkboxes are provided for users to input their filtering criteria. For instance, on an e-commerce website, users might filter products by price range, brand, or product category.

- **Card Fields Management:** Card Fields Management refers to the process of configuring and controlling the fields or attributes displayed on a digital card or card-based interface within a sunbird application.

- **Multiple Filters (Additional Filters):** The widget should support multiple filters simultaneously, allowing users to refine their search with a combination of criteria.

- **Customization:** The widget should be customizable to fit the visual style and functionality of the specific application or website.

**Description**: This configuration section is related to the Search API, which is commonly used for querying and retrieving data.

**Fields Accepted:**

- Method: The HTTP request method (e.g., GET, POST) for Search API requests.
- Headers (Optional): HTTP headers included in Search API requests.
- Body (Optional): The content of the request body for Search API requests.

### Channel Configuration:

**Description**: Similar to the Default Channel Configuration, this section pertains to the configuration of a specific channel used for data retrieval.

### StyleProps

The `StyleProps` interface defines the style props that can be used to customize the look and feel of the filter component.

The interface has three properties:

- **apiContextStyle :** This property is used to style the container that holds the API context provider.
  - `Container`: This prop is used to style the container element.
  - `Sidebar`: This prop is used to style the sidebar element.
  - `FiltersDiv`: This prop is used to style the filters div element.
  - `Filter`: This prop is used to style the filter element.
  - `Button`: This prop is used to style the button element.
  - `ListDiv`: This prop is used to style the list div element.
- **SelectStyle :** This property is used to style the select component.
  - `container`: This prop is used to style the container element.
  - `OptionNameStyle`: This prop is used to style the option name element.
  - `OptionStyle`: This prop is used to style the option element.
  - `OptionDivStyle`: This prop is used to style the option div element.
  - `select`: This prop is used to style the select element.
  - `OptionsItem`: This prop is used to style the options item element.
- **CardStyle :** This property is used to style the card component.
  - `container`: This prop is used to style the container element.
  - `headingDiv`: This prop is used to style the heading div element.
  - `heading`: This prop is used to style the heading element.
  - `type`: This prop is used to style the type element.
