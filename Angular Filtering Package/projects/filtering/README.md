# Sunbird Angular Filtering

An Angular filtering widget is a user interface component built using the React library that facilitates the process of filtering and refining data or content displayed on a web page. This widget is particularly useful when dealing with sunbird data or lists of items and allows users to interactively narrow down the displayed information based on their preferences or criteria.

## Installation

- **Prerequisites:** Ensure that you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system. You can download them from the official website: Node.js Downloads: [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

- **Create an Angular App:** If you haven't already, create an Angular application using the Angular CLI. This tool sets up a basic Angular project structure for you.

```
ng new my-app
```

- **Navigate to Your Project Directory:** Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the root directory of your Angular project.

Install the Filtering Widget Package: Use npm or yarn to install the filtering widget package. For example:

```cmd
npm install filtering-package
# or
yarn add filtering-package
```

- Import the Widget: In your React component where you want to use the filtering widget, import it at the top of your file:
- you need to import the filtering.module module. For example:

```js
import { NgModule } from "@angular/core";
import { BrowserModule } from "@angular/platform-browser";
import { AppComponent } from "./app.component";
import { FilteringModule } from "angular-sunbird-filtering";

@NgModule({
  declarations: [AppComponent],
  imports: [BrowserModule, FilteringModule],
  providers: [],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

## Project Setup

The project is set up in a modular fashion, with each folder containing code for a specific component or functionality.

```cmd
project
├── lib
│   ├── components
│       ├── cards-component
│       │   ├── cards-component.component.css
│       │   ├── cards-component.component.html
│       │   ├── cards-component.component.spec.ts
│       │   └── cards-component.component.ts
│       ├── filters-component
│       |   ├── filters-component.component.css
│       |   ├── filters-component.component.html
│       |   ├── filters-component.component.spec.ts
│       |  └── filters-component.component.ts
│       └── wrapper
│            ├── wrapper.component.css
│            ├── wrapper.component.html
│            ├── wrapper.component.spec.ts
│            └── wrapper.component.ts
├── Functions
│   ├── api.ts
│   └── Service Functions.ts
└── Interfaces
    ├── interfaces.ts
    └── Service Function_Interfaces.ts
```

The following are some of the key files in the project setup:

### Algorithms

The `Functions` folder contains the code for fetching data from a remote server and filtering functions and other important functions for optimal working.

- **api.ts :** This file defines the API endpoints. It contains the functions that are used to fetch data from the remote server.
- **service_functions.ts :** The Service Function.ts file contains the service functions that are used to process the API response and additional refactoring.

### Components

- The cards-component folder contains the source code for the `CardsComponent` component. This component is used to render a list of cards.
- The filters-component folder contains the source code for the `FiltersComponent` component. This component is used to create a filter input.
- The wrapper folder contains the source code for the `WrapperComponent` component. This component is used to wrap the CardsComponent and FiltersComponent components together.

### Interfaces

The interfaces folder contains the interface definitions. The `interface.ts` file defines the interface for the filter component. The `Service Function_Interfaces.ts` file defines the interface for the service functions.

## Features

- **Filtering Criteria:** Users can specify criteria or parameters by which they want to filter the data. This might include text-based searches, date ranges, categories, or any other relevant attributes.

- **Filter Inputs:** Input fields, dropdown menus, sliders, or checkboxes are provided for users to input their filtering criteria. For instance, on an e-commerce website, users might filter products by price range, brand, or product category.

- **Card Fields Management:** Card Fields Management refers to the process of configuring and controlling the fields or attributes displayed on a digital card or card-based interface within a Sunbird application.

- **Multiple Filters (Additional Filters):** The widget should support multiple filters simultaneously, allowing users to refine their search with a combination of criteria.

- **Customization:** The widget should be customizable to fit the visual style and functionality of the specific application or website.
